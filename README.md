# Vampire Survivors inspired game
Our game was inspired by the popular Vampire Survivors game. The game we have created is a 2D top-down roguelike game with endless gameplay. The player has to fight off waves of different enemy types each with their own abilities. Your goal is to survive as long as possible!

We used the Godot engine and we made use of GDScript as well as some C# scripts to create the game.

# How To Play
First, navigate over to the project release and download the zip file from the latest release and extract the contents of the zip file.

You will need to download the Godot engine to run the game which can be found here: https://godotengine.org/download/

Make sure that it is the Godot Engine -.NET which has C# suppport.

You will also need to download the .NET SDK file which can be found here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Once you have completed the previous steps navigate to the Godot engine and locate the import option.

Next, find the path where the project file downloaded to and once you select it click import & edit.

Once you select the project you will be able to run the game.
